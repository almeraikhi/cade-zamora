# Docker Deployment

in order to deploy the app in your docker environment, you will need the following installed:

* docker
* docker compose

You can then create a `docker-compose.yaml` similar to the [one found at the root of the repository here.](./docker-compose.yaml)

finally, run the following command in the terminal at where you created the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```
docker compose up -d
```

if `docker compose` is an unrecognized command in your system, then you are probably using the older version of docker compose. You can use this command instead:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

# Docker Build

Build the image

```
docker build -t eriexn/cade-zamora:latest .
```


# Development Guide
## prerequisites

The development environment expects that you have the following installed:

* NodeJs
* yarn
* docker 
* git

## clone the repository
start with cloning the repository. You can use your desired git tool, or run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riexn/cade-zamora.git
```

## Install the dependencies
```
yarn
```

## create `.env` file
The `.env` has values for the database connection and the node environment we're running. Initialize your file with the following:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5444/mydb?schema=public"
NODE_ENV="development"
```


## Start the database

```bash
yarn db:up
```
This will start a container with postgres 13.6 in it. It will use port `5444`.

> if your system already has the port `5444` in use, then you will [need to follow this guide](#change-the-development-database-port).


## Initialize prisma


```
yarn dx
```

This command will reset out database, initialize Prisma and it will seed the database with random data.

Use this command whenever you want the app to go back to the "initial state".

## Run the app in development mode

```
yarn dev
```

It will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`

# Change the development Database port
Our development database, which can be brought with the command `yarn db:up` will run at the port `5444`. If your system already has that port in use, or if you want to change it, then you will need to change two files.


## modify the docker compose file
<h5 a><strong><code>integrations/docker-compose.yaml</code></strong></h5>

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13.6
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - 5444:5432 
        #ðŸ‘† change this value
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```
## modify the .env file

> Note that the .env file is something you would have created by [following the development guide](#development-guide).

<h5 a><strong><code>.env</code></strong></h5>

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5444/mydb?schema=public"
                                                      #ðŸ‘† change this value         
NODE_ENV="development"
```
